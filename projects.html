            <p> This game is based off of flappy bird. It is just more intensified with effects to make it harder. Such as a rainbow screen and the pipes being hidden from your view. Instructions on how to play: 1. Repeatedly click mouse to fly upward. 2. Dodge the pipes by going in between them. This is the favorite game out of the games that I have made so far. Personally, I like the challenge that I added of having the pipes dissapear from your sight.

          <p> The point of the game is to have the snowflake avoid the squirrel and (although it isn't necessary) the cat.  There are also objects that aren't harmful towards you and rather help improve your score such as the donuts. Please check the points system listed down below:
            </p>
            <p>
              Small donut = 1 point. Medium donut = 2 points. Large donut = 3 points. Crazy Cat = -3 points. Squirrel = Death/Game over. 
                Instructions: 1. Dodge the squirrels by moving your mouse (The snowflake/you will follow the mouse) 2. Collect points for your score by collecting donuts. 3. Keep up your score by dodging cats.
