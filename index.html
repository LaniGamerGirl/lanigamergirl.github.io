            2017 marks my 4th year programming. I know the languages HTML, CSS, Scratch, and EV3 programming. The first languages I learned were the block programming formats Scratch by MIT and EV3 by Lego. Currently I am learning Javascript.

        <p class= "desc">
            I have interests in art, technology, programming, and video games. The main reason I wanted to learn how to program was because I wanted to make a game because of my passion for video games. Other hobbies that I do include swimming and water polo. I do competetive swim with DACA and do water polo with Stanford Girls Water Polo.
